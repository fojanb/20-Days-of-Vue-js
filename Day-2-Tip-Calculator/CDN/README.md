Computed properties are like data properties, except they depend on other properties.

Computed properties are written like methods, but they do not accept any input arguments.

Computed properties are updated automatically when a dependency changes, while methods are called on when something happens, like with event handling for example.

Computed properties are used when outputting something that depends on something else.
